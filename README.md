## Description
Data and script to analyze the ecomorphological diversity of Amazonian stream fishes. These results are discussed in the manuscript "Three combinations of traits summarize the ecomorphological diversity of fishes inhabiting Amazonian streams". R scripts are numbered in the order that the analyses are performed, from 01 to 06. All the data necessary to run analyses are availagle in /data and /results, so one can run any part of the script independently from running prior analysis. Make sure you install the necessary R packages before running the analysis.
